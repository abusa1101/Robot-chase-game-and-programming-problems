Comments:

- Variable names are reasonably intuitive
- Long main code. Should create more functions/modularize
- Define structures instead of multiple arrays
- Lots of variables created unnecessarily
- Could structure better
- Could learn to use functions properly (Ex: using fscanf to read each character is bad when you can just use fgetc)
